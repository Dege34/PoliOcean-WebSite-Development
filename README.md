## Overview

Welcome to the Politocean Web Project repository. As the Project Manager, I led a dedicated team in redesigning the Politocean website, which had been using the same design for over a decade. This project represents our collective effort over a span of two months to bring a modern touch to the site.<br><br>

The photos and videos provided in this repository illustrate the final version of the website, which I developed on my local machine. All code responsibilities were managed solely by me, while Mateo Sala contributed to the design and photo aspects of the project.
